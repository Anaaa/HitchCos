5. Contributing a new function
-------------------------------

Navigate to the issues tab of the repository and find an issue that you would
like to work on. Some of these issues are tagged as :code:`enhancement`. The
issue will have a description of the function that needs to be implemented, and
where the function code should be included.


Install the package in development mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To contribute any source code such a test, you need to install the package in
development mode. To do this, run the following command from the root of the
project folder::

    $ pip install -e .


Implementing your function
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In your function you need to remember to include a docstring that describes what
the function does. This is important for users of the software to understand how
to use the function. The docstring should be in the following format::

    def function_name(arguments):
        """
        Description of the function.

        Parameters
        ----------
        arguments : type
            Description of the argument.

        Returns
        -------
        type
            Description of the return value.
        """

        # code for the function


Documenting your function
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Testing your function
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before you commit your changes, you need to test your function. To do this, you
need to run the test suite. The test suite is in the :code:`tests` directory.
The test suite is written using `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/>`_.
To run the test suite, run the command from the root of the project folder::

    $ pytest tests
    ============================= test session starts ==============================
    platform linux -- Python 3.8.5, pytest-6.2.2, pluggy-0.13.1

    collected 0 items

    ============================== no tests ran in 0.01s ==============================


Committing the change
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you are done with your changes, you need to commit them. First, you need to
**stage** the files you have changed. To do this, run the following command::

    $ git add <name of the file tou want to commit>

Do this for all the files you have changed. Once you have staged all the files,
you can commit them::

    $ git commit

This will open a text editor where you can write your commit title and message.
