Make a Contribution to `listwiz`
================================

In this tutorial, we will learn how to contribute to `listwiz`.

Open-source projects are typically hosted on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or
others, with the source code managed using Git. In this tutorial, we will use
GitHub as an example. To make a contribution, you need to have a GitHub account.
You can create an account by navigating to GitHub: http://github.com. If you are
in education, you can apply for a specific education account here:
https://education.github.com.

Now that you have your account, there are a few more initial steps that you will
need to take before you can start contributing to the project. The first step is
to create a fork of the project and bring a copy of the project to your
computer:

- :ref:`Forking`

Now you are ready to start contributing. There are several tasks that you can
do, such as including documentation, writing tests, or implementing functions.
You can nagivate to the issues tab of the repository and find an issue that you
would like to work on. Once you choose what you want to work on, remember to
create a branch before you start implementing.

- :ref:`Branching`
- :ref:`ContributingDocs`
- :ref:`ContributingTest`
- :ref:`ContributingFunction`

In each section, you will find information on how to implement each step, as
well as a checklist of things you need to complete. These include compiling the
documentation, running the test suite, and committing your changes!

Now you are ready to  ask for your new developed code to be part of the source
code of the project! For that you need to follow the instructions:

- :ref:`PushingAndPullRequest`

Thus as a summary the steps you have to take can be summarised as follows:
